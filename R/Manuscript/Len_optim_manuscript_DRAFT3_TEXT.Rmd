**Abstract**

Background

Long-acting injectable pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), including Lenacapavir, offers an opportunity to accelerate HIV incidence declines in southern and eastern Africa. Given constrained HIV budgets, competing needs for health resources, and high product and delivery costs, prioritization strategies are needed to maximize HIV prevention impact and maximize value.

Methods

We used district-level estimates of HIV incidence and at-risk population sizes from the Naomi model published by UNAIDS to estimate the potential health impact and cost-effectiveness of Lenacapavir in 837 districts across 11 of the highest-burden countries in eastern and southern Africa. We evaluated the impact of universal provision (PrEP offered to all) versus risk-prioritized delivery in different geographies by sex and age. We calculated the number needed to treat, infections averted, cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted, and the threshold price at which Lenacapavir becomes cost-effective at less than 500 dollars per DALY, assuming an average \$10,000 lifetime treatment cost and 20 DALYs per HIV infection. We conducted sensitivity analyses for heterogeneity in risk of those most likely to uptake PrEP, looking specifically at districts across South Africa.

Results

In high HIV-incidence districts of southern Africa, Lenacapavir was cost-effective at a maximum cost of 130 dollars per person-year, but much lower maximum costs (under 40 dollars per person-year) were required for cost-effective delivery in lower-incidence regions. Focusing provision in the highest-incidence quintile of districts (20% of the population), could avert almost half of new infections. Assuming Lenacapavir users have more than two-fold higher HIV risk than the population average, a universal offer strategy to women aged 15 to 24 in South Africa was cost-effective across all districts. District-level cost-effectiveness maps identified settings where universal versus risk-prioritized provision would maximize impact for a given budget.

Conclusions

Marked heterogeneity in HIV incidence across districts and populations drove large differences in threshold cost and health impact of Lenacapavir provision. The highest HIV incidence districts could cost-effectively deliver Lenacapavir at higher costs than low-incidence districts. Streamlined PrEP delivery strategies with universal offer and user self-selection in high-incidence regions can achieve high impact and cost-effectiveness.

**Introduction**

The availability of highly effective long-acting pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), including the 6-monthly injectable Lenacapavir, provides an opportunity to accelerate the declines in HIV incidence observed in southern and eastern Africa over the last two decades [@birdthistle2019RecentLevelsTrends; @vandormael2019DeclinesHIVIncidencea; @akullian2020Effect909090HIV1a]. However, with reduced donor funding and increasingly constrained budgets for HIV treatment and prevention, risk prioritization will be essential to achieve meaningful impact at reasonable cost, particularly in low- and middle-income settings such as Africa where HIV burden is highest. In launching and scaling new HIV prevention tools there is an inherent trade-off between affordability and impact, which is especially pertinent in the face of current declining resources for the HIV response. HIV prevention is often only cost-effective and affordable when used by those with the highest risk of acquisition, but due to large heterogeneity in HIV risk in a population [@nagelkerke2018SignatureBiologicalHeterogeneity], most new infections occur among a greater share of the population with a moderate level of risk [@kaftan2025CostThresholdsAnticipated]. This raises questions about where, how, and to whom the newly approved Lenacapavir should be distributed.

With increasingly constrained budgets for HIV treatment and prevention and high costs associated with both procurement and delivery of LA-PrEP, prioritization to those with substantial HIV risk will be essential to maximize Lenacapavir efficiency and impact. Several risk prediction models have been developed and validated as tools to identify those at highest HIV risk based on individual-level demographic and behavioral co-variates [@balkus2016EmpiricHIVRisk; @balkus2018PerformanceValidatedRisk]. These models, however, have demonstrated low-to-moderate performance [@jia2022RiskScoresPredictinga] and often fail to predict HIV incidence in out-of-sample populations [@giovenco2019AssessingRiskHIV] . As result, these models can miss large numbers of individuals who go on to acquire HIV, and their utility in prioritizing PrEP to those who could benefit may be limited. Furthermore, implementing a risk prioritization approach adds costs and complexity to product delivery, including the effort needed to screen and reach the highest risk populations [@Jaramillo31122025]. Risk screening tools may also stigmatize populations identified as “high-risk” [@celum2020LessonsPrEPSEARCH], potentially leading to lower uptake. As a result, the use of risk-screening tools must weigh the benefits of focused prevention against the limitations and costs associated with their use.

Simpler PrEP delivery strategies, such as a universal offer of PrEP in high-incidence settings, have been proposed as an alternative to risk-prioritization models [@donnell2021IncorporatingOralPrEP; @roberts2022PredictingRiskHuman]. Universally offering PrEP overcomes the limitations of risk-screening and allows the user to decide whether and when to take PrEP based on their own risk assessment. There is potential for this approach to be both efficient and impactful. Those who self-assess elevated risk tend to have higher PrEP initiation compared to those identified via a risk scoring algorithm @koss2021HIVIncidencePreexposure, and self-assessed risk may closely align with an individual’s empirical risk @kinuthia2023RiskbasedUniversalPrEP, resulting in substantial incidence reduction in real-world settings [@donnellHeterosexualHIV1Transmission2010a]. A re-analysis of data from the ECHO trial shows that the HIV risk of those who took up PrEP was about six times higher than those who did not (corresponding to a 2-fold higher risk in prep users compared to the overall population). Models can evaluate the impact and efficiency of offering long-acting PrEP to a larger segment of the population, especially considering the potential cost savings and simplification in the mode of delivery associated with making PrEP universally available.

Most models that have evaluated the health impact and cost-effectiveness of Lenacapavir in eastern and southern Africa (ESA) have utilized complex individual-based network models [@wu; @kaftan2025CostThresholdsAnticipated]. Such models are resource-intensive to run and rely on a large amount of empiric data for model parameterization. Simpler models may provide similarly accurate results while requiring fewer parameters and being user friendly for in-country decision makers @garnett2025ChangingCosteffectivenessPrimary. Here we use small area estimates of incidence at the district level across ESA in a simple model to project the health impact and cost-effectiveness of Lenacapavir. We develop a heuristic approach for LA-PrEP prioritization using a simple set of demographics, epidemiological, and costing parameters to estimate cost-effectiveness and impact of various delivery prioritization scenarios. Our results can inform epidemiological thresholds where LA-PrEP could be offered universally versus risk-prioritized to optimize the largest impact for the lowest cost. Our modeling approach can be leveraged for other similar analyses of HIV prevention scale up.

**Methods**

Simple mathematical formulas were used to estimate the direct health impact and cost-efficiency of long-acting PrEP. Equation inputs included baseline incidence (in the absence of PrEP), PrEP efficacy, duration of protection, and population coverage (See appendix for equation inputs).

Parameterization and assumptions

Model parameters and values are shown in Table 1. We assumed Lenacapavir efficacy of 95% for 6 months based on phase III efficacy trials, which found 100% protection against HIV acquisition among cis-gender females and 96% efficacy in a population of cis-gender men, transgender women, transgender men, and gender-non-binary persons [@bekker2024TwiceyearlyLenacapavirDaily,@kelley2025TwiceyearlyLenacapavirHIV]. We assumed a USD 10,000 lifetime treatment cost of someone living with HIV, a function of the cumulative costs of diagnosis and care derived from the average discounted costs per year of treatment summed over the expected lifetime of the average person living with HIV. We assumed 20 DALYs associated with HIV from the proportion of PLHIV who lose their life from the infection and the cumulative disability experienced over a lifetime of infection, again discounted.

We assumed a baseline Lenacapavir cost of \$130 per person per year, which reflects the fully loaded costs of Lenacapavir provision including drugs (assumed to be \$40 + a \$17 loading dose based on recent negotiations with Gilead [cite]), HIV testing, personnel, consumables, and demand generation. We varied this cost in sensitivity analyses. HIV prevalence and incidence data by geography, age, and sex were based on UNAIDS calculations which were estimated using their NAOMI model @Eaton2021. NAOMI synthesizes data from population-based surveys and sentinel surveillance to provide estimates of the local pattern of HIV infection. HIV prevalence and incidence estimates were applied in the cost-effectiveness and impact equations to estimate the populations for which the use of Lenacapavir will be cost-effective.

Our base case calculations assume that those using Lenacapavir have the average risk for the sex and age group in their district. However, within these demographically defined groups there is likely heterogeneity in risk, due to a complex set of behavioral and biological factors. For our primary analysis we assume that individual-level risk heterogeneity in the population follows a gamma distribution: r \~ Gamma (shape k, scale θ), where k is fixed to account for within-district skew, and scale is set using district-level incidence. Gamma distributions have been used to represent skewness in the distribution of transmissions and acquisitions across a population for several infectious diseases @hilton2024BetaPoissonModelInfectious. In HIV epidemics gamma distributions can be used to approximate the skewness in the number of sexual partners per year @anderson1988EpidemiologicalParametersHIV, where a small fraction of individuals has high activity versus a larger fraction with average or low activity. For our analysis we assumed risk follows an exponential gamma distribution with a shape parameter of 1 to represent a highly skewed distribution of risk, following previous work [@rose2021]. We used Lorenz concentration curves to estimate the cumulative fraction of new infections that occur in a cumulative share of the population at risk (ordered by risk from high to low). Supp Figure 1a illustrates the different functional forms of risk heterogeneity at the individual-level, by varying the skewness of a gamma distribution across different shape values (0.1, 1, 10) and the corresponding Lorenz concentration curves (Supp Fig 1b). In the case of a gamma with shape 1 (equivalent to an exponential distribution), more than 50% of infections fall within the top 25% of the population with the highest risk and those in this population have on average, twice the risk of the general population.

We conducted several sensitivity analyses to explore different assumptions regarding DALYs associated with a PLHIV, lifetime treatment costs of a PLWHIV, and the risk quantile of the population most likely to uptake PrEP based on a derived risk heterogeneity curve. Assumed DALYs per HIV infection vary across modeling studies according to differences in life-expectancy assumptions, treatment coverage, and model structure, (Ma & Ollendorf, 2020; Kahn et al., PLoS Med 2006). We therefore ran models under more conservative assumptions of 15 DALYs associated with an HIV infection and lifetime treatment costs of USD 5,000 (Table 1). Dynamic HIV epidemic models imply values in a similar range, (10–20 DALYs per infection), derived from dividing total DALYs averted by infections averted (Bansi-Matharu et al., Lancet Glob Health 2022). For the risk-heterogeneity assumption, we tested the sensitivity of our results across four groups represented as quantiles of the risk distribution (0-25%, 25-50%, 50-75%, and 75-100%), corresponding to groups with a relative difference in risk from the district-level mean of \<0.5, 0.5-1, 1-2, and \>2, respectively. Based on results from the ECHO trial, which found offering PrEP universally resulted in people who initiated PrEP having twice the HIV risk as the average population risk, representing 25% of the population [@donnellHeterosexualHIV1Transmission2010a].

**Results**

District-level heterogeneity in HIV incidence by age and sex is shown in Figures 1 and 2. Among women, district-level HIV incidence is highest in the 20–24-year age group across most districts – though in some districts in South Africa, incidence was highest in the youngest age group. Incidence was lowest in those 35 years and older. In contrast, male HIV incidence was universally higher across districts among those 20 years and older, with especially low incidence in the 15–19-year age group (Figure 1). HIV incidence mapped in Fig 2a was heterogeneous across districts in eastern and southern Africa, with the highest incidence among adults of both sexes aged 15-49 years in Southern Africa and pockets of high incidence in east Africa (figure 2a). Due to geographic heterogeneity in incidence across districts, most HIV infections are concentrated in a small fraction of the population (figure2b). Overall, 50% of new infections could be prevented by covering less than 20% of the population with Lenacapavir. However, as Lenacapavir coverage increases its efficiency declines as more districts with lower incidence are included.

Figure 3 displays geographic heterogeneity in the number needed to treat (NNT), cost per DALY averted, and maximum fully loaded per-dose cost for Lenacapavir to be cost-effective (when \<500 USD per DALY is the threshold for cost-effectiveness) in similar maps derived from the underlying district-level incidence. Districts where HIV incidence is high have lower NNT, lower cost per DALY averted, and higher price threshold at which Lenacapavir would be cost effective. South Africa, Mozambique, and eSwatini have several districts where less than 200 individuals at risk would require Lenacapavir to avert one infection which leads to a price threshold over 100USD.

To explore which districts could efficiently offer universal (regardless of assessed risk) Lenacapavir to a specific age-group (in this case 15-24-year-old women) we map the number of districts within a country where universal offer would be cost-effective (at a threshold of 500 USD/DALY averted) as a function of the Lenacapavir cost (Figure 4). Panel A shows the districts where a universal offer to women age 15-24 years would be cost-effective if the cost of Lenacapavir were 130 USD per person per year (red outlined districts) versus 40 USD per person per year (red and maroon outlined districts), and in panel B shows a sliding scale for the cost of Lenacapavir with the cumulative percentage of HIV infections averted, with more districts added as the cost declines. For most of South Africa, Mozambique, eSwatini, and Lesotho, Lenacapavir would be cost effective for a price of \< 130 USD per person per year. In lower-to-moderate incidence regions, the cost at which Lenacapavir is cost-effective is substantially lower. At 40 USD/pp/yr most districts in southern Africa and several districts in eastern Africa meet the cost-effectiveness threshold.

We focus on South Africa's 52 districts to compare the impact and cost effectiveness of district-level allocation targeting different risk-groups (each represented as one of four quartiles of a theoretical continuous risk distribution). When allocated to a population with \>2 times the district-level incidence, (the uptake assumption for universal offer of PrEP), Lenacapavir would reach a subset of women 15-24 with a district-level incidence of `r cell("baseline", 0.875, "female", "15-24", "incidence")` per 1000 py, a `r cell("baseline", 0.875, "female", "15-24", "relative incidence")` fold higher incidence than the district average, at an average cost per DALY averted of `r cell("baseline", 0.875, "female", "15-24", "cost per DALY")`. At \$130 per person per year, Lenacapavir could be universally offered to women 15-24 in all 52 districts, at a coverage of `r cell("baseline", 0.875, "female", "15-24", "CE len coverage $130 pt")` (among all adults at risk 15-49) averting an estimated `r cell("baseline", 0.875, "female", "15-24", "CE infections averted $130 pt")` of infections. Under similar uptake assumptions, Lenacapavir was cost-effective when delivered universally in 46 of 52 districts among women 25-34 (a coverage of `r cell("baseline", 0.875, "female", "25-34", "CE len coverage $130 pt")` averting an estimated `r cell("baseline", 0.875, "female", "25-34", "CE infections averted $130 pt")` infections), 45 of 52 districts in men 25-34 (a coverage of `r cell("baseline", 0.875, "male", "25-34", "CE len coverage $130 pt")` averting an estimated `r cell("baseline", 0.875, "male", "25-34", "CE infections averted $130 pt")` of infections, 40 of 52 districts in women 35-49 (a coverage of `r cell("baseline", 0.875, "female", "35-49", "CE len coverage $130 pt")` averting an estimated `r cell("baseline", 0.875, "female", "35-49", "CE infections averted $130 pt")` infections)) (Table 2). At \$40 per person per year Lenacapavir could cost-effectively delivered to more than 45 districts among women 15-24 in all but the lowest risk strata (representing those with \<0.5 times the district-level incidence), in women 25-34 and 35-49 and in men 25-34 in the two highest risk strata (\>1 times the district-level incidence), and men 15-24 and 35-49 in the highest risk strata (\>2 times the district-level incidence) (Table 2).

Our results were sensitive to the assumed number of DALYs associated with an HIV infection and lifetime treatment costs associated with an HIV infection. Using lower values for both parameters () wer found that at \$130 per person per year, Lenacapavir could be universally offered to women 15-24 in XXXX districts, at a coverage of `r cell("sensitivity", 0.875, "female", "15-24", "CE len coverage $130 pt")` (among all adults at risk 15-49) averting an estimated `r cell("baseline", 0.875, "female", "15-24", "CE infections averted $130 pt")` of infections. Under similar uptake assumptions, Lenacapavir was cost-effective when delivered universally in 46 of 52 districts among women 25-34 (a coverage of `r cell("baseline", 0.875, "female", "25-34", "CE len coverage $130 pt")` averting an estimated `r cell("baseline", 0.875, "female", "25-34", "CE infections averted $130 pt")` infections), 45 of 52 districts in men 25-34 (a coverage of `r cell("baseline", 0.875, "male", "25-34", "CE len coverage $130 pt")` averting an estimated `r cell("baseline", 0.875, "male", "25-34", "CE infections averted $130 pt")` of infections, 40 of 52 districts in women 35-49 (a coverage of `r cell("baseline", 0.875, "female", "35-49", "CE len coverage $130 pt")` averting an estimated `r cell("baseline", 0.875, "female", "35-49", "CE infections averted $130 pt")` infections)) (Table 2). At \$40 per person per year Lenacapavir could cost-effectively delivered to more than 45 districts among women 15-24 in all but the lowest risk strata (representing those with \<0.5 times the district-level incidence), in women 25-34 and 35-49 and in men 25-34 in the two highest risk strata (\>1 times the district-level incidence), and men 15-24 and 35-49 in the highest risk strata (\>2 times the district-level incidence) (Table 2).

Figure 5 shows the cumulative % of infections that could be averted among adults 15-49 in South Africa by allocating Lenacapavir to an increasingly inclusive set of districts comparing a scenario where Lenacapavir is prioritized to the average risk group to one where it is prioritized to a risk-group with twice the risk as the general population (representing the upper quartile of the continuous risk distribution). In the average uptake scenario, a Lenacapavir coverage of 1% yielded a 3% reduction in incidence (among all adults 15-49) and a coverage of 3% yielded a 9% reduction in risk in the same age-group. In the higher risk uptake scenario, a 1% coverage yielded a 7% reduction in risk, and a 3% coverage yielded a 16% reduction in risk. We compare these results to two-point estimates (shown in black triangles) from a previously published mathematical model of Lenacapavir impact in South Africa where Lenacapavir is prioritized to the highest risk sub-populations based on behavioral factors (namely female sex workers (FSW), their clients, and adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) with 2+ sex partners). In this model a 1% coverage of Lenacapavir resulted in a 12% reduction in incidence, and a 3 % coverage resulted in a 20% reduction, a relatively similar effect as our higher risk uptake geographic model. Our sensitivity analyses compared cost effectiveness of district-level allocation of Lenacapavir in South Africa under different assumptions on the HIV risk of those initiating Lenacapavir (Figure 6). When individuals using Lenacapavir have 1–2-fold greater risk of HIV acquisition than the population average, Lenacapavir is generally cost-effective across districts, and at \> 2-fold greater risk it is likely cost-saving.

Figure 7 displays district-level maps in South Africa showing where universal offering of Lenacapavir would be cost-effective under an average versus high (twice the district-level average) uptake assumption. Under the average uptake assumption, universal offer would only be cost effective for women under 25 years in most districts in the eastern part of the country where incidence is higher. Under the higher risk uptake assumption, many more districts are under the cost-effectiveness threshold of \<\$500/DALY. In this scenario, focusing universal offer of Lenacapavir to 20–35-year-old men and women would be a cost-effective strategy

**Discussion**

In this analysis, we applied a heuristic model based on district-level HIV incidence to project the health impact and cost-effectiveness of different Lenacapavir (LENACAPAVIR) prioritization scenarios across ESA. Despite its relative simplicity and minimal set of covariates, our model can be used to estimate impact, cost-effectiveness, and maximum cost thresholds to achieve cost-effectiveness based on the number needed to treat to avert one infection and the costs of an infection. District-level cost thresholds can guide decision-making around regarding the geographic regions in which Lenacapavir can be efficiently allocated universally versus requiring a risk-prioritized approach in the face of budgetary constraints and opportunity costs. Universal allocation offers practical advantages for policymakers, who must make urgent decisions with constrained budgets and limited data.

A geographic approach to Lenacapavir allocation overcomes several important limitations of delivery using targeting based on behaviors. Previous risk-prediction models have been developed to identify those at highest risk of HIV based on demographic and behavioral factors like number of recent sexual partners, marital status, presence of an STI, and frequent alcohol use [cite]. However, these models have limited predictive performance, largely because they are trained on self-reported sexual behavior data, which can be unreliable. A well-known risk scoring model for HIV risk, for example, demonstrated moderate performance (a combined area under the curve (AUC) = 0.62) when validated using data from several adult populations across eastern and southern Africa, and poor performance (AUC of 0.55) when used to predict HIV acquisition in a large cohort of young South African women [@giovenco2019AssessingRiskHIV]. These tools can also inadvertently stigmatize prep use, which impairs the normalized adoption of PrEP in high-incidence communities. If a prevention product is considered a marker of certain higher-risk sexual behaviors, it may not be widely accepted. Additionally, risk screening can add substantial costs and complexity to delivery programs, often requiring trained providers to counsel and administer screening questions. Risk screening can also increase stigma. As a result, the utility and feasibility of behavioral risk screening as a prioritization tool for LA-PrEP is limited.

In response to the pitfalls of behavioral risk-targeting, new approaches to delivery have been proposed to allow an individual to self-assess their own risk and decide whether and when to use PrEP. This universal delivery approach overcomes many of the limitations of behavioral screening – it reduces stigma, instills agency and trust in the individual, and may streamline prep implementation [@celum2020LessonsPrEPSEARCH]. Real-world evidence supports the impact and efficiency of the universal offer approach. Risk scoring tools have been shown to perform only as well as self-assessment of risk – with similar incidence in those identified as high risk by both modes of selection [@kinuthia2023RiskbasedUniversalPrEP]. Furthermore, providing PrEP without restriction can produce high impact and efficiency at the population level. In the ECHO trial, a study on the effects of hormonal contraceptive on HIV risk, when oral PrEP was made available to all women half-way through the trial, 25% of the women initiated PrEP, resulting in a 50% reduction in population-level HIV incidence [@donnell2021IncorporatingOralPrEP], suggesting good alignment with HIV risk periods. This study supports the theory that the highest risk individuals will uptake PrEP when it is offered to all.

The mechanism of self-selection by risk builds natural efficiency into delivery programs that have historically been challenged in their ability to reach the groups in most need of prevention, thus expanding the map where HIV programs can offer Lenacapavir universally without suffering from lower efficiency. In lower incidence areas, self-selection may not be sufficient to justify universal offer, and in those areas a more targeted approach is likely needed to achieve cost-effective impact. Still, geographic prioritization may save time and money for HIV programs that would otherwise be spent on reaching and screening populations for eligibility. These cost savings may further increase the efficiency of geographic approach to delivery. Further data collection from Lenacapavir delivery programs can provide valuable information who is most likely to initiate prep. These lessons can help improve models to guide more effective Lenacapavir allocation for the greatest impact.

There are several limitations to our modeling approach that must be considered in the interpretation of our results. First, we assume an average lifetime costs of HIV care (\$10,000) and a DALY burden for living with HIV (20). Our per-HIV infection DALY estimate is higher than recent estimates from HIV transmission models (e.g., 10–16 DALYs in EMOD-HIV estimates [cite]) but lower than values assumed in older models conducted when treatment coverage was lower (e.g., 28–40 used in IHME or Avenir analyses [cite]). DALYs per HIV infection are highly sensitive to assumptions about life expectancy (LE), ART coverage, and disability weights for treated and untreated HIV. A longer LE assumption (e.g., 80 vs 66 years) increases the estimated DALYs per HIV infection substantially, while the years lived with disability (YLD) component contributes less, given the relatively low disability weights for individuals on ART and the short duration of untreated advanced disease. Our per-infection DALY values also implicitly assume an average age at infection and treatment trajectory that may differ across countries, and they exclude indirect benefits from secondary infections averted. Results from our sensitivity analysis, in which we varied the assumed DALY per infection from 15 to 40, resulted in XXXX. We also tested alternative assumptions about lifetime treatment and care costs associated with an HIV infection. Our base case assumption of \$10,000 is consistent with previous estimates from South Africa [cite] but may be higher than in other settings with lower treatment costs. In sensitivity analyses, we varied this cost from \$5,000 to \$15,000 and found that our results were sensitive to this assumption, with higher lifetime treatment costs resulting in higher maximum cost thresholds for Lenacapavir to be cost-effective.

We also adopt a conventional \$500 per DALY threshold for cost effectiveness which may not correspond with the explicit or implicit value used by decision makers in a specific country. Our model only estimates the direct impact of Lenacapavir over a short time-period and does not include transmission dynamics needed to estimate the number of subsequent infections averted from preventing a single case (herd immunity). This includes the number of vertical transmissions that would be averted by covering pregnant women with Lenacapavir. Therefore, our results likely underestimate the real impact of Lenacapavir. Second, our model does not include explicitly defined risk groups with relatively larger levels of risk like sexual minority men or women who engage in sex work. We assume a continuous distribution of risk in a population that may not reflect the true heterogeneity in risk across discrete groups defined by sexual behavior. However, models that do incorporate these groups must make large assumptions on the sizes and relative incidence rates of those groups – data that are often unavailable or unreliable.

Our analysis has several strengths. We utilize a simple modeling approach yet our results regarding health impact and maximum per dose costs are similar to a more complex modeling analysis. Therefore, our modeling framework can more easily be utilized by policymakers to assess the efficiency of Lenacapavir across heterogeneous geographic regions.

**Conclusion**

Mapping the cost-effectiveness and impact of Lenacapavir illustrates where universal provision to demographic groups would and would not be the optimal policy. The expansion in cost-effective districts as the cost of Lenacapavir decreases can be calculated. Results can inform policy decisions for efficient Lenacapavir implementation.

- *D*: DALYs associated with HIV infection

**3. Maximum price per dose (price threshold):**\
$$
K_{max} = \frac{T + D \cdot C_d}{NNT}
$$

**4. Annual infections averted (impact):**\
$$
A = I \cdot f \cdot e \cdot Pop \cdot (1 - P)
$$\
Where:\
- *f*: coverage of target population\
- *P*: HIV prevalence\
- *Pop*: total population

All calculations were stratified by age, sex, geography, and assumed different prioritization scenarios.
